In the early years of the web (circa 1994), I published a web page with a list of my favorite web sites and maybe an article or two. I was the first in the university to have a personal website.

The very first few personal websites at the time consisted of a list of links to their most recently found favorite sites. There were a few who was journaling on the web but there weren't many. I remember following [Justin Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hall)  and [Meng Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Weng_Wong). to me they were the early bloggers (the term did not exist at the time) -- in pure [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and maybe some [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) scripts for efficiencies.

It was a time long before Wordpress and Moveable Type.

Later on in life I started a personal blog that I co-authored with my wife specifically for family and friends. The url was hidden from the world -- it was much easier to do so during that time (circa 2000). I wrote a blogging software to facilitate that. Incidentally, around that same time [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org) was created and open sourced.

We blogged for a few years and later stopped as life got too busy -- mostly we got lazy.

Around the beginning days of [JRoller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Roller) and [Java Lobby](https://www.javalobby.org/about.jsp) (circa 2002), I started blogging to the general public. It was a series of programming posts about [Java](https://java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml) and [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). While I had a decent amount of readers, It only lasted a few months. I was not consistent and never made time for it.

My blogging has always consisted of status reports and/or how-to articles. It was rarely about my thoughts or ideas.

As an introvert, publishing my thoughts or ideas openly to the world has always been a little bit intimidating. By doing it, I am revealing parts of me and overtime all of me. In a lot of ways I feel **naked** every time I do so or attempt to.

However, I feel compelled to do so now:
- It's a way to connect with like minded folks from around the world.

- It forces me to think through and _sanitize_ my thoughts.

- If I think about something a lot, I might as well write about it and share.

- It's a way to gather feedback on ideas and opinions. Helps me keep an open mind.

- It improves my ability to communicate. The ability to put thoughts into words efficiently and effectively is something I wish to master.

Recently, I started publishing my opinions in short blurbs to a small circle on Facebook. It is time I publish more than short blurbs and it is time I publish to the world. It is outside my comfort zone and that alone gives me reason.

It is time I get naked.
