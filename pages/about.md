# About

I am Justin. Some people call me [Jus (juice)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jus).

A software engineer since the early days of the web, I now lead and work with engineering teams at early stage startups in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Whether it be building software or teams, making a positive impact on people is what matters to me.

I believe in _building things that really matter_.
