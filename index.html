<p><big>I</big>n the early years of the web (circa 1994), I published a web page with a list of my newly discovered favorite web sites and maybe an article or two. I was the first at my university to have a personal website.</p>

<p>The very first few personal websites at the time consisted of a list of links to their most recently found favorite sites. There were a few who was journaling on the web but there weren’t many. I remember following the journals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hall">Justin Hall</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Weng_Wong">Meng Wong</a>. To me they were the early bloggers (the term did not exist at the time) – doing it in pure <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">HTML</a> and maybe some <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> scripts for automation and efficiencies.</p>

<p>Later on in life I started a personal blog that I co-authored with my wife specifically for family and friends. The url was hidden from the world – it was much easier to do so during that time (circa 2000). I wrote a blogging software to facilitate that. Incidentally, around that same time <a href="https://www.movabletype.org">Moveable Type</a> was created and open sourced and <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> was starting to gain momentum. I did not seize the opportunity but that’s another story.</p>

<p>We blogged to a private audience of friends and family for a few years and later stopped as life got too busy – mostly we got lazy.</p>

<p>Around the beginning days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Roller">JRoller</a> and <a href="https://www.javalobby.org/about.jsp">Java Lobby</a> (circa 2002), I started blogging to the general public through FreeRoller. It was a service that hosted JRoller blogs for free.</p>

<p>I wrote a series of posts about <a href="https://java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>. While I had a decent amount of readers, It only lasted a few months. I was not consistent and never made time for it.</p>

<p>My blogging has always consisted of status reports and/or how-to articles. It was rarely about my thoughts or ideas.</p>

<p>As an introvert, publishing my thoughts openly to the world has always been a little bit intimidating. By doing it, I am revealing parts of me and overtime all of me. In a lot of ways I feel <strong>naked</strong> every time I do so or attempt to.</p>

<p>I feel there are opportunities lost.</p>

<p>I wish to change that. Here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a way to connect with like minded folks from around the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It forces me to think through and <em>sanitize</em> my thoughts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I think about something a lot, I might as well write about it and share.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a way to gather feedback on ideas and thoughts. Helps me keep an open mind and I am likely to learn something.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It improves my ability to communicate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to put thoughts into words efficiently and effectively is something I wish to master.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lately, I’ve been publishing my thoughts in short blurbs to a small circle of friends on Facebook. It is time I publish more than short blurbs and it is time I publish to the world. It is outside my comfort zone and that alone gives me reason.</p>

<p>It is time I get naked.</p>
